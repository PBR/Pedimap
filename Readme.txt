Pedimap: software for the visualization of genetic and phenotypic data in pedigrees.

Pedimap was written in the C++ Builder 6 flavor of C++.
The required files to build the executable are in the sources folder.
Because C++ Builder 6 does not run under current Windows versions
and the original source no longer compiles with the successors
of C++ Builder 6, the original executable is included in the
installation folder. This executable runs under all 32-bit and
64-bit Windows versions (at least up to the current -2021-
version of Windows 10).
